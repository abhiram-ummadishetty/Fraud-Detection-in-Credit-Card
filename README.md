# Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is a sophisticated security measure that financial institutions employ to identify and prevent fraudulent activities. This system uses advanced algorithms to analyze transaction data, detecting unusual patterns or anomalies in real-time. 


## Data Gathering:
Collect historical credit card transaction data, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, forming the basis for training and testing your model.

## Data Preparation:
Clean and organize the data, addressing missing values, outliers, and data imbalances.
Create meaningful features from the transaction data to improve the model's performance.

## Data Split:
Divide the data into training and testing sets, reserving a portion for model evaluation.

## Feature Scaling:
Ensure all features are on the same scale through normalization or standardization.

## Model Selection:
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for fraud detection, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.

## Model Training:
Train the chosen model on the training data to distinguish legitimate from fraudulent transactions based on the engineered features.

## Performance Metrics:
Define relevant evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Emphasize recall to minimize missing fraud cases.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tune the model's settings for optimal performance using the validation data.

## Model Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance on the test data using the chosen metrics.

## Threshold Setting:
Establish a threshold for classifying transactions as legitimate or fraudulent, allowing customization to control false positives and false negatives.

## Deployment:
Deploy the model in a real-time or batch processing system to evaluate incoming credit card transactions for potential fraud.

## Real-time Scoring:
In the deployment environment, each transaction is scored by the model. Transactions exceeding the threshold trigger further review or may be declined.

## Monitoring and Updates:
Continuously monitor the model's performance in a production environment, periodically retraining it with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

## Feedback Loop:
Create a feedback mechanism to collect additional labeled data from the live system to enhance the model's performance over time.

## Documentation and Compliance:
Document the entire process and ensure regulatory and security compliance in handling sensitive financial data.

Regular model updates, collaboration with experts, and adherence to industry regulations are essential for maintaining the effectiveness and security of your fraud detection system.
